**3** Assumptions & Design Decisions

1) Component-Based Architecture: Key components like ConfigForm (settings input) and ChatPreview (live preview).
2) State Management: Uses Reactâ€™s useState for managing configurations.
3) Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling.
4)Color & Image Configurations: file upload for images but the color code hex inputs are not editable , you have to select it from the sketch-picker.

**4** Known Issues

1) Some responsiveness improvements needed for very small/large screens.
